// The SignUpButton component is a client component that is used in the NavBar component. It is a simple component that renders a link to the /signup page with the text "Sign Up". The SignUpButton component is a client component because it does not require server-side rendering and can be safely loaded on the client side. This allows the component to be loaded faster and reduces the server load.
